<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I’m an Assistant Professor at the Computational Science Lab of the University of Amsterdam. My research focuses on the interdisciplinary domain of high-performance multi-scale models, with the primary applications derived from the context of biomedical research. My overall strategy builds on three pillars: <br>
&emsp;<b>(I)</b> high-performance computing, <br>
&emsp;<b>(II)</b> basic physiology research, <br>
&emsp;<b>(III)</b> clinical applications. <br>
These operate in strong synergy to unlock answers that are not possible in a single-domain view. On the one hand the application of high-performance computing techniques allows fundamental investigations (such as cellular-scale mechanisms) in extreme detail. These complement the capabilities of experimental methods and allow access to detail that is not possible with the current measurement technologies. On the other hand, multi-scale computational methods enable the transfer of knowledge from fundamental research towards clinical applications.
In both cases the high-performance computing techniques provide the necessary means to design and build <i>achievable</i> (good scaling in performance and energy usage) and <i>actionable</i> (verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification) solutions. I develop these methods primarily within the context of the Digital Human Twin (aka. Virtual Human), with the prospect of most methods being tranferrable to a wider range of the upcoming Digital Twins.
<br>
In the international landscape I maintain several strong interdisciplinary collaborations with groups of experimentalists and medical professionals. I lead the development of <a href="https://www.hemocell.eu">HemoCell</a>, the open-source high-performance cellular blood flow simulation. I participate in multiple H2020 projects with computational focus (as participant or co-PI), which provides me with overview and active connection to several of the top research groups in Europe developing in silico technologies.
