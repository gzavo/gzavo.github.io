I’m an Assistant Professor at the Computational Science Lab of the University of Amsterdam. My research interest and curiosity revolve around unsolved biomedical challenges, with the primary focus on large-scale and coupled problems. In my work I find the interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists and medical professionals to be of central importance. Therefore, I maintain active links and ongoing cooperations with several clinical institutes and experimental groups across Europe. Being embedded in multiple H2020 projects (as participant and co-PI) with computational focus provides me with overview and active connection to many of the top research groups in Europe developing _in silico_ technologies. 
I’m coordinating the development of [HemoCell](https://www.hemocell.eu), the open-source state-of-the-art high-performance cellular blood flow simulation. This code is currently deployed at more than a dozen HPC centres and it was recently executed on over a quarter-million CPU cores, overcoming significant technological challenges in order to investigate the blood flow and thrombus formation in the event of vessel damage on the cellular level.
