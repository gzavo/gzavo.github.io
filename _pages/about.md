My goal is to introduce _Digital Twins in Healthcare_ that allow us to explore human physiology **beyond experimental limits** and directly **inform clinical decisions**. By combining high-performance computing, biomedical modeling, and rigorous validation, I strive to translate fundamental insight into reliable, patient-specific clinical tools. I combine expertise from three synergistic domains to achieve this:

&emsp;<b>(I) High-Performance Computing </b> — I develop scalable computational frameworks like [HemoCell](https://www.hemocell.eu), an open-source cellular blood flow simulator that achieves exceptional parallel efficiency (>80% on 300,000+ CPU cores) and enables investigations at cellular resolution that exceed current experimental capabilities.

&emsp;<b>(II) Fundamental Biomedicine </b> — My work advances understanding of [blood rheology](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/31/3/031903/260133), [platelet aggregation dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.109010), and mechanosensitive processes in thrombosis through validated computational models that reproduce emergent transport characteristics of complex cellular systems.

&emsp;<b>(III) Clinical Applications </b> — I translate fundamental insights into actionable clinical tools, [including virtual medical device deployment simulations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cnm.3340) for endovascular aneurysm treatment and patient-specific models for stroke intervention planning.

This interdisciplinary approach unlocks insights inaccessible through single-domain methods, and enables solutions that are both _achievable_ (optimized for performance and energy efficiency) and _actionable_ (rigorously verified, validated, and uncertainty-quantified).
