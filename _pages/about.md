I’m an Assistant Professor at the Computational Science Lab of the University of Amsterdam. My research interest and curiosity evolve around unsolved biomedical challenges, with the primary focus being on cardiovascular diseases. In my work I find the interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists and medical professionals to be of central importance. I have actively invested effort in building connections and taken non-incremental steps to establish collaboration and good communication with several leading medical experts. As a result, I have active links and ongoing collaborations with several clinical institutes and experimental groups across Europe. 
Being embedded in multiple H2020 projects (as participant and co-PI) provides me with overview and active connection to many of the top research groups in Europe developing _in silico_ technologies. Furthermore, I’m coordinating the development of HemoCell [www.hemocell.eu], the open-source state-of-the-art high-performance cellular blood flow simulation. This code is currently deployed at more than a dozen HPC centres and it was recently executed on over a quarter-million CPU cores, which is a significant technological challenge, to investigate the blood flow and thrombus formation in the event of vessel damage.
