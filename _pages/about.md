<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I’m an Assistant Professor at the Computational Science Lab of the University of Amsterdam, and an Assistant Professor at the Budapest University of Technology.
I answer biomedical challenges by delivering high-performance computational solutions.
My research trajectory focuses on three pillars: *(I)* basic physiology research, *(II)* clinical applications, *(III)* high-performance computing. These operate in strong synergy to enable novel answers, that are not possible in a single-domain view. The advanced computational tools enable fundamental investigations in extreme detail, extending the capabilities of the experimental settings. High-performance computing and multi-scale modelling then allow the scale-up of the results to the level of clinical applications. This strategy creates the possibility for me to develop _actionable_ (verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification) and _achievable_ (scaling in performance and energy usage) solutions.
<br>
In the international landscape I maintain several strong interdisciplinary collaborations with groups of experimentalists and medical professionals. I lead the development of <a href="https://www.hemocell.eu">HemoCell</a>, the open-source high-performance cellular blood flow simulation. I participate in multiple H2020 projects with computational focus (as participant or co-PI), which provides me with overview and active connection to several of the top research groups in Europe developing in silico technologies.
