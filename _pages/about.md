I’m an Assistant Professor at the Computational Science Lab of the University of Amsterdam. I’m the main developer of HemoCell [www.hemocell.eu], the open-source HPC blood flow simulation package. My main research interest lies in high-performance multi-scale biomedical computations with application in vascular diseases, endovascular medical device research, and cellular suspension physics. 

Focus and interest
