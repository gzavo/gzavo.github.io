# Stochastic simulations

Programme: Computational Science Master

[Course catalog](http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2021-2022-en/search-course/course/88901)

**Goals**

The course introduces the foundations of the most important stochastic methods in computer simulations. These methods are applicable in a wide range of context that spans from modelling the behavior of network systems to financial systems, to in-silico clinical trials. The main objectives are:

* Understand the foundations of probability theory and how it is applicable to various stochastic processes.
* To be able to construct and evaluate stochastic models to simulate various real-world systems from finance to biomedicine.
* To be able to analyze and test the validity of such models.
* To be able to interpret correctly the predictions of these stochastic models.

# Project Computational Science

Programme: Informatics Bachelor

[Course catalog](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2021-2022/zoek-vak/vak/89334)

**Goals**

The purpose of this intensive, hands-on course is to successfully complete a computational science project in a small team. The final deliverable is a report, accompanied by a functional software which simulates a real-world phenomenon and performs statistical analysis. It is specifically required for any project to have both a modeling & simulation component as well as a statistical data analysis component. In the previous block in the Minor Computational Science you completed smaller assignments in only one of these two components. In this course you will perform a larger project which combines the two.
