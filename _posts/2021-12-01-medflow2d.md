* Custom 2D LBM solver capable of handling porous materials and turbulence (Smagorinsky model). 
* OpenMP parallel design, written in C. 
* Real-time monitoring tools written in python. 
* HDF5 data format.
* It has a simple thrombus formation model built-in. 
* The simulation geometry can be "painted" in any image editor.
