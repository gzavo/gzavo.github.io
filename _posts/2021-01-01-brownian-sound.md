Every song is made using a completely different platform, different software, different method, different hardware. And of course, a different genre. They also explore various mixing techniques, some are recorded live, but none is professional quality.
This EP is the collection of my first 7 songs produced for fun and to try out the available tools. They represent a Brownian motion like exploration of the bedroom-producing possibilities of an absolute beginner.

Used tools:
* iPad (Gadget 2, Cubasis 3, various synths)
* Digitakt
* FL Studio
* Electric guitar
* Arturia MikroFreak
* Roland MC-101
* ...probalby other things I could get my hands on...
