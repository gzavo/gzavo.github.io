## Problem
Flow diverter planning often relies on virtual deployment methods that capture geometry but not validated device mechanics. This project develops a deployment model that preserves physically meaningful braid behavior.

## Approach
- Build a spring-mass representation of braided flow-diverter devices.
- Calibrate force response against experimental measurements from real devices.
- Simulate deployment maneuvers including push-pull effects.
- Quantify apposition and expansion behavior in patient-specific vessel geometries.

## Key finding
The method reproduces key mechanical deployment responses while retaining practical flexibility for treatment scenario exploration.

## Why it matters
Mechanically faithful virtual deployment reduces uncertainty in simulated post-treatment hemodynamics and supports safer intervention planning.

- Publication details are listed in the **References** section below.
- Deployment and post-treatment flow visuals are included on this page.
