## Problem
Cerebral aneurysm risk is strongly linked to local hemodynamics, but classical metrics can miss unstable transport structures. I aimed to quantify whether diseased arterial geometries induce chaotic flow behavior that changes residence time and exposure patterns.

## Approach
- Simulate unsteady blood flow in patient-relevant artery geometries.
- Track transport structures and mixing patterns in three-dimensional data.
- Quantify fractal characteristics of flow-driven transport features.
- Compare patterns with conventional interpretations of aneurysm-related flow fields.

## Key finding
The aneurysm-affected geometries developed strong instabilities that drove the system toward chaotic transport. Fractal signatures and altered residence-time patterns were measurable, even in complex 3D settings.

## Why it matters
Quantifying chaotic transport adds a complementary lens for clinical risk interpretation. It helps connect geometry-driven flow instability to biologically relevant exposure mechanisms.
