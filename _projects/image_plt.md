## Problem
Early thrombus growth depends on local shear and transport, but aggregate microstructure is often simplified away in simulations. I investigated whether image-derived aggregate geometry and density significantly change local hemodynamic predictions.

## Approach
- Reconstruct aggregate outline and internal density from microscopy experiments.
- Model aggregates as porous structures with permeability informed by microstructure.
- Simulate flow and transport under multiple imposed wall shear rates.
- Quantify shear, elongation, kinetic force, and local Péclet behavior inside and around aggregates.

## Key finding
Both shear rate and aggregate microstructure strongly affected local transport and mechanical loading. Transition zones between shell and core showed pronounced force signatures relevant to structural interpretation.

## Why it matters
Including experimentally informed microstructure improves mechanistic understanding of how flow shapes thrombus initiation and evolution.
