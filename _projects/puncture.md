## Problem
At the onset of vascular puncture, platelet transport and local flow asymmetry can determine whether hemostasis remains controlled or escalates pathologically. I studied this early phase in a geometry representative of microneedle and insect-bite injuries.

## Approach
- Build a punctured-vessel in silico model with cell-resolved blood dynamics.
- Develop a matched in vitro flow-chamber setup for experimental comparison.
- Vary puncture diameter and pressure-drop conditions.
- Quantify local shear, elongation, and cell distribution asymmetries around the wound neck.

## Key finding
Both simulations and experiments showed directional asymmetry near the puncture neck, with distinct distal/proximal aggregation behavior linked to local transport patterns.

## Why it matters
The platform provides a mechanistic testbed for separating healthy hemostatic response from thrombosis-prone flow conditions in puncture injuries.
