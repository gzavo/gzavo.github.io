## Problem
Children receiving vascular grafts often outgrow fixed-size implants, which can require repeated procedures over time. The project investigates whether a mechanically expandable graft concept can maintain function while adapting to growth.

## Approach
- Design optimization of vascular graft geometries with growth-accommodating structural behavior.
- Evaluate geometric expansion behavior under clinically relevant deformation ranges.
- Use simulation workflows to check expected flow compatibility and mechanical feasibility.
- Iterate designs toward robust opening behavior without severe lumen disruption.

## Key finding
The auxetic-inspired scaffold concept supports controlled expansion trajectories and offers a promising route to growth-following vascular support devices.

## Why it matters
A graft that safely adapts over time could reduce surgical burden and improve long-term quality of life for pediatric vascular patients.

## Outputs
- Concept visuals and motion examples are shown on this page.
- The project currently focuses on design validation and translational feasibility analysis.
