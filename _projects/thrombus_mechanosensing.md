## Problem
Platelet adhesion in arterial thrombosis is strongly flow-dependent, but the specific role of elongational flow, cell-free layer effects, and hematocrit is often difficult to isolate. This project studies those coupled mechanosensitive drivers.

## Approach
- Analyze high-shear and high-gradient flow conditions relevant to early thrombosis.
- Focus on elongational flow regimes that enhance vWF-mediated adhesion.
- Compare how flow profile changes alter platelet-wall interaction likelihood.
- Relate transport and adhesion tendencies to micro-mechanical blood environment features.

## Key finding
The combination of elongational flow exposure, hematocrit level, and near-wall cell distribution strongly modulates platelet adhesion propensity in thrombosis-prone conditions.

## Why it matters
This mechanistic view helps explain why apparently similar vessel geometries can produce very different thrombotic outcomes.
