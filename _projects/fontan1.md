## Problem
Fontan patients face elevated thrombosis risk, but identifying where and why risk concentrates inside patient-specific anatomies remains challenging. I investigated whether detailed flow metrics can locate high-risk regions under realistic respiratory and inflow conditions.

## Approach
- Build a patient-specific TCPC model with clinically relevant boundary conditions.
- Include turbulence modeling, hepatic inflow effects, and respiratory waveform variation.
- Quantify shear rate, elongation rate, helicity, and particle-age indicators.
- Compare high-flow and low-flow conditions to map risk asymmetry.

## Key finding
The study identified distinct zones with elevated high-shear and low-shear thrombotic potential. Risk location depended strongly on local geometry and transient inflow regime.

## Why it matters
Better localization of hemodynamic risk supports targeted monitoring and can help prioritize intervention planning for vulnerable Fontan patients.

## Outputs
- MSc thesis: [L. Schutte - Computational modelling of thrombotic risk in the Fontan circulation](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=record_51711)
- Additional outputs are integrated through ongoing Fontan studies.
