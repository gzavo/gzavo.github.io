Mechanosensitive processes have a strong influence on the first stages of the thrombus formation. The adhesion of platelets, which occurs both in physiological hemostasis, as well as pathological thrombosis, is found to be highly shear dependent and sensitive to hydrodynamic alterations. The shift of initially even shear gradients, e.g. caused by a sudden reduction in vessel diameter (vasoconstriction), leads to the presence of so called elongational flows. These flow fields, defined by exerting tensile forces, are found to promote PLT adhesion under certain conditions, enabled by the mediation of prominent plasma molecule von Willebrand factor (vWF). Furthermore, PLT adhesion is known to depend on the presence of a CFL as well as the level of hematocrit.The effects of these essential blood flow parameters on PLT adhesion were investigated under static flow conditions, in straight geometries.
