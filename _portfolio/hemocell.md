HemoCell has been used in various scenarios, for instance:
* Platelet aggregation in complex geometries
* Platelet margination in healthy and diabetic blood flows
* Stress on the wall of retinal micro-aneurysms
* Cellular conditions for high-shear thrombus formation

HemoCell has a series of advanced boundary conditions, including:
* Periodic
* Continuous cellular inflow
* Rotating boundary
* Lees-Edwards
